As a regular runner, I own a Garmin Fenix 3. The watch is quite nice, but it still runs into some issues occasionally. Today it is dead frozen, and won't respond to any keys and the time stays unchanged. A soft rest is needed, and here is the steps I found about [how to to soft reset](https://www.facebook.com/GarminFenix3/posts/449892701802307):

Basically what you need to do for a soft reset is to hold the 'light' button until it restarts.
