## When to use Cassandra

## Upgrade to cassandra 4.x driver and spring-data-cassandra 2.3.+

## CQL Tips

#### Using timestamp columns in cql where clause

Although Cassandra stores timestamp fractions using the `.ffffff` format defined by the ISO 8601 standard. However, when interacting with the database (ie. INSERT, SELECT, ...) you need to use the `.fff` format like so:

```bash
cqlsh:test_keyspace> select * from timestamp_table ;

timestamp                       | other_field
---------------------------------+---------------
2018-05-18 03:08:58.246000+0000 | Other content
2018-05-18 03:08:58.000000+0000 | Other content

cqlsh:test_keyspace> select * from timestamp_table WHERE timestamp='2018-05-18 03:08:58.123+0000';

timestamp                       | other_field
---------------------------------+---------------
2018-05-18 03:08:58.123000+0000 | Other content
```

- [14 Things To Do When Setting Up a New Cassandra Cluster](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2019/01/30/new-cluster-recommendations.html)
  - It's interesting that this article suggest disabling the materialized view when you setup a cassandra cluster. This might be a good advice!

Another very nice article describes issues around tombstones: https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2018/07/05/undetectable-tombstones-in-apache-cassandra.html


## Allow filtering

- [Allow filtering explained](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2014/12/allow-filtering-explained)

## In Query

Not using `in` query across multiple partitions, as explained in [this article](https://lostechies.com/ryansvihla/2014/09/22/cassandra-query-patterns-not-using-the-in-query-for-multiple-partitions/)


## Batch

### `batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb`
If you use `batch` with cassandra and saw warning in logs like this:
> BatchStatement.java:287 - Batch of prepared statements for [test, test1] is of size 6419, exceeding specified threshold of 5120 by 1299.

Normally this is not really harmful as it's just a warning. But you need to be careful about the usage of the `batch` and should avoid sending large paylaod to `batch` statement, especially when the statements are not against the same partition.


## Lightweight Transaction (LWT)
